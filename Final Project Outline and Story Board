## Final Project Part 1

## Outline

**Summary**

For my final project, I am focusing on the state of the US juvenile justice system. I want to show that although juvenile detention rates have declined dramatically, the US still incarcerates more children than any other country. I will highlight how the juvenile justice system disproportionally impacts minority youth, is mainly concentrated in non-violent offenses and perpetuates the challenges children who are already at a disadvantage face. Many states have already implemented laws to improve their juvenile justice systems and hopefully more awareness around the current state of the system will generate support for future initiatives.

Quick Summary - The US is locking up disadvantaged children, mainly for non-violent crimes, and is providing little in the way of support. US kids deserve more than the current juvenile justice system.    

**Project Structure**

I imagine my project starting with a broad perspective. I will state that although juvenile detention rates have declined, the US still remains the country that incarcerates the most youth. I will then put a personal face on the juvenile justice system by telling the story of someone who went through the system and how they ended up in detention. From there, I will expand the focus to look at demographic trends of the juvenile justice system and try to show who is being incarcerated and why. I will follow with data about the outcome and experiences of children who are in juvenile detention centers. This should support the idea that detention and only punitive measures are not an effective way to combat juvenile crime/behavioral problems. I will end with a call to action to support organizations that advocate for the rights of incarcerated youth and legislation that aims to improve the juvenile justice system.

**User Stories**

As a reader I want juvenile detention to be used sparingly and only for the most violent offenses so kids will not face limited opportunities. 

As a reader I want kids to have access to education and the support they need so they can have better outcomes. 

## Initial Sketches

![Sketches](Sketches.JPG)

For these sketches I focused on what has stood out to me in the data so far: the US being a global leader in youth incarceration, the significant decrease of incarcerated youth, the over representation of minorities in the juvenile justice system, the large amount of incarcerated youth that have experienced trauma and high rates of re-arrest. I thought most about how to make these points standout in visual form when I was sketching.  


## Data

I will be using a lot of data from the statistical briefing book of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/). This site offers a massive amount of publically available data about arrest rate, court cases, and detention rates for US youth. For these measures, I also have access to demographic information such as race and gender and the type of office. This source also offers information about detention facilities themselves, such as types of educational and mental health services that are available. Although OJJDP, has tons of data, I thought it was interesting how they had little to no data about youth outcomes who had been detained or about measures of success that placement facilities could use to evaluate themselves. For information of this type, I found data within research studies and reports from non-profits.

## Method and Medium

My next step for my final project is to do a more in-depth analysis of the data I’ve found. I have alot of data from OJJP, so I’ll need to go through the data and see what is most relevant and informative. A more thorough analysis of the data will help me figure out what trends stand out in the data and what aspects of the data I should highlight. I'll also need think more about how data from the research and non-profits reports can complement and expand on the data from OJJP. I also feel like my project is on the broader side at the moment so I'll look into ways of narrowing my scope so I can have a more effective narative. Doing this, will also give a more exact idea about what sorts of visualizations will be best for my project. 

I’ll use data visualization tools like tableau, datawrapper and rawgraphs to make my visualizations. I’ll also rely on user feedback as I make and rework my visualizations. For my final deliverable, I’ll use shorthand so I can create a narrative with my data visualizations. 

I’ll also do more qualitative research to give my projects additional dimensions. I’ll look for personal stories about experiences with the juvenile justice system, which will hopefully add another more emotional layer to my project. I also want to better understand what non-profit organizations supports this issue and what current legislation looks like for this issue.

## User Research Protocol

**Audience and Interview Candidate Selection Process** 

I believe my topic has a wide audience. I think it's one that most people will care and be concerned about.  I understand my audience as anyone who lives in America or even more broadly: anyone who could spread awareness about the state of the juvenile justice system. As I think my topic has a wide reach, I believe any individual could be a good candidate for me to interview. I’ll do my best to find a wide range of people who vary in age, program or politics. 

**Interview Script**

Introduction - Hi. My name is Melanie. I’m taking Telling Stories with Data this semester. For my final project, I’ve decided to look at the US juvenile justice system. Do you have some time to take a look at the rough draft of my final project and answer a few questions?
What is your first reaction to the graph as in what do you think the graph means the first time you see it? (for each visualization) 
Does that meaning change when you’ve had more time to look at the visualization? (for each visualization) 
What do you think of the organization and structure of the project?
Is there anything you found confusing or think needs additional information?
What do you think is the main message of the project?
Final thoughts? Do you have any final comments?


**Interviewees**

**Interview Findings**

**Question 1 and 2**

Section 1. This graph got a good response in terms of the meaning I wanted to convey. Everyone that I interviewed thought this graph was clear and was able to understand its meaning quickly. I did get comments about the text in section 1, specifically the however. I meant this as a transition and this might not be an issue when my project is in shorthand and someone would be scrolling through the story instead of looking at it page by page. The other comment about the text I got was that I should define what youth means. This is a good comment and I will make sure to define youth as someone who is under 18. I also got a comment that it could be interesting to include other factors on the line graph. For example has the gender breakdown stayed constant over time or has it changed?

Section 2. The people I interviewed were able to understand this graph’s meaning quickly. 

Section 3. This graph’s meaning was clear as well. Although, I did receive comments that its meaning could be more immediately clear. I think I could color more effectively to highlight the point I want to make. 

Section 4. This graph got several comments about how it was confusing. Someone pointed out that the violent offenses were vertical and the non-violent offense were horizontal. I also got another good comment about how the legend was not in the same order as the graph. There were other comments about the readability of this graph, but I hope this will be corrected when the graph is in digital form. I also left out a subtitle for this graph of what the graph is depicting. 

Section 5.1 The people I interviewed thought that the pie charts were clear. For the third graphic, I got a comment that my color legend should reflect the order of the visualization. Again, I need subtitles for these graphs giving more specific information about what they are showing. I also got comments that there is too much text on this page, which is something I will have more control over when I’m working in shorthand. 

Section 5.2 - The people I interviewed thought the dot chart was clear and communicated its intending meaning quickly.

Section 6. I got comments that the first graph is lost in the wording and that I should let the bar chart stand out more. I got a good response on the above and below aspect of the bar chart, but I think I might need to think about the units on the y-axis a bit more. I did not get comments about how the second visualization (stick figures). I think I’ll need to add more description to this visualization

Section 6.2 People thought the visualizations were clear in this section. I did get several comments about how this section is cluttered and that I could use white space more effectively. I also received a comment that I could potentially use a graphic of a coin toss instead of a pie chart for the first visualization. 

Section 7. Several people found the first graph confusing. The dates looked as if they could possibly be labeling the first three bars instead of showing that they represent different time frames. I also received comments about how the section labels could be moved to the left, in front of the lines to increase readability. The second graph was clear and communicated its meaning quickly. However, an interviewee pointed out that I had labeled the second bar as do not re-enroll. This was a great catch and I’ll definitely review my labels more carefully in the future.   

Section 8. For this graph, I received a question about what re-arrest means. This person also found the wording new convictions confusing. All interviews did not realize that the grey signified a range of values. I’ll need to find a way to make this clearer. One interviewee also mentioned how she wished she saw the rate of re-enrolling in highschool on this graph, especially since I reference this in the chart’s title. However, I do not have data for high school re-enroll rates broken up by within 2 years or 3 years or later.  Maybe I could find another way, though, to incorporate this metric into the graph. Interestingly, all interviews also commented that the label 3 years after release was confusing and that 3 years or later might be a better wording.  

Section 9. All of my interviews found this last section confusing and do not think the extent of the situation was unclear. I definitely explained more to people about this section than any other. I’ll need to find a way to more effectively visually communicate what I want to say.  People also wanted more information about the context and were also curious about how many states did collect this data. They wanted to know more than just how many states used data. Someone also commented that the vertical barchart is not that effective of anway to show the breakdown of how states use data.    

**Question 3**

The people I interviewed were fine with the order and structure of the project. No one had any comments around this topic.

**Question 4**

Everyone mentioned that they wished there was more context in section nine and thought that section could be expanded. 

**Question 5**

Two people I interviewed thought the main message of the project was that there are serious issues with the US juvenile justice system. Another person thought the main message of the project was the racial disparities present in the US juvenile justice system. Both are points that I wanted my project to stress. 


**Question 6**

One interviewee mentioned that he wished there was a section on the cost of the juvenile justice system and said that could further emphasize the project’s point. He thought this section could potentially be before the recidivism section. Other final comments were more theoretical about what it means that this data is in some cases not even being collected.
