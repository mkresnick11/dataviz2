# User Research Protocol

**Audience and Interview Candidate Selection Process** 

I believe my topic has a wide audience. I think it's one that most people will care and be concerned about.  
I understand my audience as anyone who lives in America or even more broadly: anyone who could spread awareness 
about the state of the juvenile justice system. As I think my topic has a wide reach, I believe any individual 
could be a good candidate for me to interview. I’ll do my best to find a wide range of people who vary in
age, program or politics. 

**Interview Script**

Introduction - Hi. My name is Melanie. I’m taking Telling Stories with Data this semester. For my final project, I’ve decided to look at 
the US juvenile justice system. Do you have some time to take a look at the rough draft of my final project and answer a few questions?

1. What is your first reaction to the graph as in what do you think the graph means the first time you see it? (for each visualization) 

2. Does that meaning change when you’ve had more time to look at the visualization? (for each visualization) 

3. What do you think of the organization and structure of the project?

4. Is there anything you found confusing or think needs additional information?

5. What do you think is the main message of the project?

6. Final thoughts? Do you have any additional comments?


**Interviewees**

1. Woman, Late 20's, Heinz Student
2. Woman, early 20's, Heinz Student
3. Man, Late 50's, Retired


**Interview Findings**

**Questions 1 and 2**

Section 1. This graph got a good response in terms of the meaning I wanted to convey. Everyone that I interviewed thought this graph was clear and was able to understand its meaning quickly. I did get comments about the text in section 1, specifically the however. I meant this as a transition and this might not be an issue when my project is in shorthand and someone would be scrolling through the story instead of looking at it page by page. The other comment about the text I got was that I should define what youth means. This is a good comment and I will make sure to define youth as someone who is under 18. I also got a comment that it could be interesting to include other factors on the line graph. For example has the gender breakdown stayed constant over time or has it changed?

Section 2. The people I interviewed were able to understand this graph’s meaning quickly. 

Section 3. This graph’s meaning was clear as well. Although, I did receive comments that its meaning could be more immediately clear. I think I could color more effectively to highlight the point I want to make. 

Section 4. This graph got several comments about how it was confusing. Someone pointed out that the violent offenses were vertical and the non-violent offense were horizontal. I also got another good comment about how the legend was not in the same order as the graph. There were other comments about the readability of this graph, but I hope this will be corrected when the graph is in digital form. I also left out a subtitle for this graph of what the graph is depicting. 

Section 5.1 The people I interviewed thought that the pie charts were clear. For the third graphic, I got a comment that my color legend should reflect the order of the visualization. Again, I need subtitles for these graphs giving more specific information about what they are showing. I also got comments that there is too much text on this page, which is something I will have more control over when I’m working in shorthand. 

Section 5.2 The people I interviewed thought the dot chart was clear and communicated its intending meaning quickly.

Section 6. I got comments that the first graph is lost in the wording and that I should let the bar chart stand out more. I got a good response on the above and below aspect of the bar chart, but I think I might need to think about the units on the y-axis a bit more. Someone pointed out to me that the I had zero between the two 50%s, which was confusing since that is meant to show the average acedemic performance. Also the negative 50% is confusing and isn't what I want to show - which is being below average, not a 50% decrease.  be I did not get comments about how the second visualization (stick figures). I think I’ll need to add more description to this visualization

Section 6.2 People thought the visualizations were clear in this section. I did get several comments about how this section is cluttered and that I could use white space more effectively. I also received a comment that I could potentially use a graphic of a coin toss instead of a pie chart for the first visualization. 

Section 7. Several people found the first graph confusing. The dates looked as if they could possibly be labeling the first three bars instead of showing that they represent different time frames. I also received comments about how the section labels could be moved to the left, in front of the lines to increase readability. The second graph was clear and communicated its meaning quickly. However, an interviewee pointed out that I had labeled the second bar as do not re-enroll. This was a great catch and I’ll definitely review my labels more carefully in the future.   

Section 8. For this graph, I received a question about what re-arrest means. This person also found the wording new convictions confusing. All interviews did not realize that the grey signified a range of values. I’ll need to find a way to make this clearer. One interviewee also mentioned how she wished she saw the rate of re-enrolling in highschool on this graph, especially since I reference this in the chart’s title. However, I do not have data for high school re-enroll rates broken up by within 2 years or 3 years or later.  Maybe I could find another way, though, to incorporate this metric into the graph. Interestingly, all interviews also commented that the label 3 years after release was confusing and that 3 years or later might be a better wording.  

Section 9. All of my interviews found this last section confusing and do not think the extent of the situation was unclear. I definitely explained more to people about this section than any other. I’ll need to find a way to more effectively visually communicate what I want to say.  People also wanted more information about the context and were also curious about how many states did collect this data. They wanted to know more than just how many states used data. Someone also commented that the vertical barchart is not that effective of anway to show the breakdown of how states use data.    

**Question 3**

The people I interviewed were fine with the order and structure of the project. No one had any comments around this topic.

**Question 4**

Everyone mentioned that they wished there was more context in section nine and thought that section could be expanded. 
 
**Question 5**

Two people I interviewed thought the main message of the project was that there are serious issues with the US juvenile justice system. Another person thought the main message of the project was the racial disparities present in the US juvenile justice system. Both are points that I wanted my project to stress. 


**Question 6**

One interviewee mentioned that he wished there was a section on the cost of the juvenile justice system and said that could further emphasize the project’s point. He thought this section could potentially be before the recidivism section. Other final comments were more theoretical about what it means that this data is in some cases not even being collected. 

 # Revised wireframes
 
 I still have a lot of work left to do for my visualizations. I'm not sure how to make group symbol charts so I'll need to look into this. I also think a lolipop chart go be effective for certain parts of data, so I'll look into this as well. 
 Also, while I was able to improve my treemap, I could not figure out how to make each section vertical which was a suggestion I got during an interview. I also couldn't figure out how to stack bar charts for my visualizations of educational outcomes while detained. I am pretty happy with the digital version of my first three charts which are below:
